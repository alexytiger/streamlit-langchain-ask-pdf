#important notice:
# Yes, the Streamlit app will continue to run even if `return` is used in any function, 
 # including your `main()` function.

#The important thing to understand here is that the `return` statement in Python 
# just exits the current function and hands the program execution back to its caller. 

#In the context of Streamlit, when a user interacts with an input widget (like your file uploader), 
# the entire script gets rerun from top to bottom. 
# So after returning from `main()`, Streamlit will immediately start over again 
# from the top of your script, waiting for the next interaction.

#Here's a simple way to visualize it:

#'''
#def main():
    # some logic here
#    return

# This part keeps running despite return in main()
#if __name__ == "__main__":
#    while True:
#        main()

#'''


#So, while the `return` statement does end the `main()` function prematurely, 
# the Streamlit application will not stop running due to the nature of the framework's execution model. 
# It will still be active, waiting for further user interactions.
